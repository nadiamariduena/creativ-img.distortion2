### SECOND TEST üçå

#### The First time i tried to follow this tutorial i failed.

For that reason I decided to train my skills with another tutorial from the same youtuber, this time things worked differently. I structured the project in a different way before i started the lesson, so i did the same with this one, now i can finally see the project, of course with no animations on the images or the animated scroll, its a good thing because in my first try i had a blank page.

#### This is how the project looks before start adding all the animation related elements
